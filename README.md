|    2 |              So she throws something -> |                 to Eve.                 |                                                                    |

|    4 |                                         |            ..send it to Bob->           | Gotcha!                                                            |
|    5 |                                         |                                         | Bob get the two messages from Alice and Eve.                       |

|  ... | Alice repeatedly sends messages to Bob. | And Eve repeatedly intercepts messages. | Bob can also send Alice messages.                                  |
|    n |                                         |                                         | Bob thinks he got the correct string, and send it to the computer. |

## Who is winning?
- Alice and Bob are winning if and only if Bob gets Alice's message.
- Eve is winning if and only if Bob gets Eve's message.
- The computer(me!) is winning if and only if Bob gets neither Alice's nor Eve's message.
## What will the "secret string" be?
It will be a string of `syllable`s, randomly generated by the computer.

A syllable is a vowel after a consonant, or a consonant after a vowel. For example, `phe` and `ouf` are syllables, but `aeo` or `fc` are not.
## Transmission!
During each transmission, every letter has a chance of 20% to lost and a chance of 30% to be a random letter. So pay attention, what you get may **not** be what he/she sent!
